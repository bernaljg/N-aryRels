We described an approach to multi-task learning. Our approach is based on multi-objective optimization. In order to apply multi-objective optimization to MTL, we described an efficient algorithm as well as specific approximations that yielded a deep MTL algorithm with almost no computational overhead. Our experiments indicate that the resulting algorithm is effective for a wide range of multi-task scenarios.
