\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper we introduced SiamMask, a simple approach that enables fully-convolutional Siamese trackers to produce class-agnostic binary segmentation masks of the target object.
We show how it can be applied with success to both tasks of visual object tracking \emph{and} semi-supervised video object segmentation, showing better accuracy than state-of-the-art trackers and, at the same time, the fastest speed among VOS methods.
The two variants of SiamMask we proposed are initialised with a simple bounding box, operate online, run in real-time and do not require any adaptation to the test sequence.
We hope that our work will inspire further studies that consider the two problems of visual object tracking and video object segmentation together.
