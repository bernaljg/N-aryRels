  \caption{Search space for the toy case of a binary vocabulary and sequences of length 4.  
    The trees represent all the $2^4$ possible sequences.
  The solid black line is the ground truth sequence. 
  \textbf{(Left)} Greedy training such as XENT optimizes only the probability 
  of the next word. The model may consider choices indicated by the green arrows, but it starts off from words taken from the ground truth sequence. The model experiences exposure bias, since it sees only words branching off the ground truth path;
  \textbf{(Right)} REINFORCE and MIXER optimize over all possible sequences, using the predictions made by the model itself.  
  In practice, the model samples only a single path indicated by the blue solid line. The model does not suffer from exposure bias; the model is trained as it is tested.}
