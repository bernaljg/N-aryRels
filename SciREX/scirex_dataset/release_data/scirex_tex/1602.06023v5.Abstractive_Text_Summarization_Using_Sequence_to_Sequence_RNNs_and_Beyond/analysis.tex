\section{Qualitative Analysis}\label{sec:analysis}

%In this section, we present representative output from our models and discuss them qualitatively. 
Table \ref{fig:example_outputs} presents a few high quality and poor quality output on the validation set from {\it feats-lvt2k-2sent}, one of our best performing models. Even when the model differs from the target summary, its summaries tend to be very meaningful and relevant, a phenomenon not captured by word/phrase matching evaluation metrics such as Rouge. On the other hand, the model sometimes `misinterprets' the semantics of the text and generates a summary with a comical interpretation as shown in the poor quality examples in the table. Clearly, capturing the `meaning' of complex sentences remains a weakness of these models.

Our next example output, presented in Figure \ref{fig:example_pointers}, displays the sample output from the switching generator/pointer model on the Gigaword corpus. It is apparent from the examples that the model learns to use pointers very accurately not only for named entities, but also for multi-word phrases. Despite its accuracy, the performance improvement of the overall model is not significant. We believe the impact of this model may be more pronounced in other settings with a heavier tail distribution of rare words. We intend to carry out more experiments with this model in the future.

On CNN/Daily Mail data, although our models are able to produce good quality multi-sentence summaries, we notice that the same sentence or phrase often gets repeated in the summary. We believe models that incorporate intra-attention such as \newcite{lstmn} can fix this problem by encouraging the model to `remember' the words it has already produced in the past.
