\section{Conclusions}

In this paper we have proposed a deep encoding and decoding framework
for image restoration. Convolution and deconvolution are combined,
modeling the restoration problem by extracting primary image content and recovering details.

More importantly,we propose to use skip connections, which helps on recovering
clean images and tackles the optimization difficulty caused by gradient
vanishing, and thus obtains performance gains when the network goes deeper.
Experimental results and our analysis show that our network achieves better
performance than state-of-the-art methods on image denoising,
image super-resolution, JPEG deblocking and image inpainting.
