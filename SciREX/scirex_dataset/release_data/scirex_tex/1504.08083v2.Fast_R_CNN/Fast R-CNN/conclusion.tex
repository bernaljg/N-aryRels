\section{Conclusion}

This paper proposes Fast R-CNN, a clean and fast update to R-CNN and SPPnet.
In addition to reporting state-of-the-art detection results, we present detailed experiments that we hope provide new insights.
Of particular note, sparse object proposals appear to improve detector quality.
This issue was too costly (in time) to probe in the past, but becomes practical with Fast R-CNN.
Of course, there may exist yet undiscovered techniques that allow dense boxes to perform as well as sparse proposals.
Such methods, if developed, may help further accelerate object detection.
