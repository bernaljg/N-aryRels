This paper proposes a Fast Region-based Convolutional Network method \emph{(Fast R-CNN)} for object detection.
Fast R-CNN builds on previous work to efficiently classify object proposals using deep convolutional networks.
Compared to previous work, Fast R-CNN employs several innovations to improve training and testing speed while also increasing detection accuracy.
Fast R-CNN trains the very deep \vggsixteen network 9\X faster than R-CNN, is 213\X faster at test-time, and achieves a higher mAP on PASCAL VOC 2012.
Compared to SPPnet, Fast R-CNN trains \vggsixteen 3\X faster, tests 10\X faster, and is more accurate.
Fast R-CNN is implemented in Python and C++ (using Caffe) and is available under the open-source MIT License at \url{https://github.com/rbgirshick/fast-rcnn}.
