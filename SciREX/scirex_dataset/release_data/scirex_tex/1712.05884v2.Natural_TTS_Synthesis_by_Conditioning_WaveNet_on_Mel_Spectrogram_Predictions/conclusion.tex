\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper describes Tacotron~2, a fully neural
TTS system that combines a sequence-to-sequence recurrent network with attention
to predicts mel spectrograms with a modified WaveNet vocoder.  The resulting system synthesizes
speech with Tacotron-level prosody and WaveNet-level audio quality. This system
can be trained directly from data without relying on complex feature
engineering, and achieves state-of-the-art sound quality close to that of
natural human speech.
