Though presented as an application paper, we have touched two fundamental problems: First, how to generate an orderless set of entities. Towards building generative models for more sophisticated combinatorial data structures such as graphs, knowing how to generate a set may be a good starting point. Second, how to capture the ambiguity of the groundtruth in a regression problem . Other than 3D reconstruction, many regression problems may have such inherent ambiguity. Our construction of the MoN loss by wrapping existing loss functions may be generalizable to these problems.
