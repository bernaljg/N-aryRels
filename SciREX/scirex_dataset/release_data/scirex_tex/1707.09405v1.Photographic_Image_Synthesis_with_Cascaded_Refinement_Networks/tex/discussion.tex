We have presented a direct approach to photographic image synthesis conditioned on pixelwise semantic layouts. Images are synthesized by a convolutional network trained end-to-end with a regression loss. This direct approach is considerably simpler than contemporaneous work, and produces much more realistic results. We hope that the simplicity of the presented approach can support follow-up work that will further advance realism and explore the applications of photographic image synthesis. Our results, while significantly more realistic than the prior state of the art, are clearly not indistinguishable from real HD images. Exciting work remains to be done to achieve perfect photorealism. If such level of realism is ever achieved, which we believe to be possible, alternative routes for image synthesis in computer graphics will open up.
