\section{Discussion and conclusion}

In this work, we propose a simple baseline method for text
classification. Unlike unsupervisedly trained word vectors from word2vec, our
word features can be averaged together to form good sentence representations.
In several tasks, \texttt{fastText} obtains performance on par with recently
proposed methods inspired by deep learning, while being much faster.  Although
deep neural networks have in theory much higher representational power than
shallow models, it is not clear if simple text classification problems such as
sentiment analysis are the right ones to evaluate them.  We will publish our
code so that the research community can easily build on top of our work.
