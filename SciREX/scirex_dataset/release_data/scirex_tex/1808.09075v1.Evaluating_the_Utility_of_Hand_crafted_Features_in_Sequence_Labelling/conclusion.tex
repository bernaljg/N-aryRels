\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we set out to investigate the utility of hand-crafted features. 
To this end, we have presented a hybrid neural architecture to validate this hypothesis extending a Bi-LSTM-CNN-CRF by incorporating an auto-encoder loss to take manual features as input and then reconstruct them. 
On the task of named entity recognition, we show significant improvements over a collection of competitive baselines, verifying the value of such features.
Lastly, the method presented in this work can also be easily applied to other tasks and models, where hand-engineered features provide key insights about the data.
