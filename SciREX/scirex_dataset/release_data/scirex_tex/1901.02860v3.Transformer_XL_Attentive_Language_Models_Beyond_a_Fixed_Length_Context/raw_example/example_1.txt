Kershaw started the 2010 season by posting a 3.07 ERA in April, but did so by walking 22 batters in 29 innings. On May 4, he had his worst start of his career against the Milwaukee Brewers at Dodger Stadium, throwing just 57 pitches in 11 ⁄ 3 innings, while retiring only four of the 13 batters he faced — including the pitcher. He was booed loudly upon being pulled from the game. Kershaw said after the game, " I didn 't give our team any kind of chance. It's just not a good feeling to let your teammates down, let everybody down. It stings, it hurts. I 've got to figure things out. " 
Kershaw rebounded his next start by pitching an 8 inning two-hitter and out-dueling the then undefeated Ubaldo Jiménez. He credited his control of the slider being the major turning point for him. Later in the season, he was suspended for five games after hitting Aaron Rowand of the Giants with a pitch in a game on July 20. The incident occurred after both teams were given a warning following Giants ace Tim Lincecum hitting Matt Kemp earlier in the game. He threw his first career complete game shutout on September 14, 2010 also against San Francisco and finished the season with a record of 13 – 10 and a 2.91 ERA in 32 starts, pitching 2041 ⁄ 3 innings and recording 212 strikeouts.
