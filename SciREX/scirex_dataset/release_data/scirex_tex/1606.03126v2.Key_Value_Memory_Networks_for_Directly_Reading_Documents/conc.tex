We studied the problem of directly reading documents in order to answer questions,
concentrating our analysis on the gap between such direct methods and using
human-annotated or automatically constructed KBs.
We presented a new model, Key-Value Memory Networks, which helps bridge this gap,
outperforming several other methods across two datasets, \WikiMovies and {\sc WikiQA}.
However, some gap in performance still remains. \WikiMovies serves as an
 analysis tool to shed some light on the causes.
Future work should try to close this gap further.

Key-Value Memory Networks are versatile models for reading documents or KBs and answering
questions about them---allowing to encode prior knowledge about the task at hand
in the key and value memories. These models could be applied to storing and
reading memories
for other tasks as well, and future work should try them in other domains,
such as in a full dialog setting.
