\section{Conclusion}

We presented a cycle-consistent adversarial domain adaptation method that unifies cycle-consistent adversarial models with adversarial adaptation methods.
CyCADA is able to adapt even in the absence of target labels and is broadly applicable at both the pixel-level and in feature space.
An image-space adaptation instantiation of CyCADA also provides additional interpretability and serves as a useful way to verify successful adaptation.
Finally, we experimentally validated our model on a variety of adaptation tasks: state-of-the-art results in multiple evaluation settings indicate its effectiveness, even on challenging synthetic-to-real tasks.
