\subsection{Algorithm}
\label{sec_alg}

Algorithm~\ref{alg_overall} summarizes the training process of two main stages: large-scale DNN training (line 1-5) and meta-transfer learning (line 6-22). HT meta-batch re-sampling and continuous training phases are shown in lines 16-20, for which the failure classes are returned by Algorithm~\ref{alg_Meta}, see line 14.
Algorithm~\ref{alg_Meta} presents the learning process on a single task that includes episode training (lines 2-5) and episode test, i.e. meta-level update (lines 6). In lines 7-11, the recognition rates of all test classes are computed and returned to Algorithm~\ref{alg_overall} (line 14) for hard task sampling.
