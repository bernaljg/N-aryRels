\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}

In this paper, we propose an end-to-end framework to tackle the multi-passage MRC task . We creatively design three different modules in our model, which can find the answer boundary, model the answer content and conduct cross-passage answer verification respectively. All these three modules can be trained with different forms of the answer labels and training them jointly can provide further improvement. The experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms the baseline models by a large margin and achieves the state-of-the-art performance on two challenging datasets, both of which are designed for MRC on real web data.
% In this paper, we propose an end-to-end framework that can finding answer from multiple passages by comprehensively considering the the boundary and the content of the answer as well as the cross-passage answer verification. We design three sub-models that can be trained with supervised labels and we show that jointly training them can provide further improvement. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on two challenging datasets designed from real-world search engines and large-scale web data.
