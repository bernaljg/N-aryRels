\section{Implementation details}
The proposed V2V-PoseNet is trained in an end-to-end manner from scratch. All weights are initialized from the zero-mean Gaussian distribution with $\sigma$ = 0.001. Gradient vectors are calculated from the loss function and the weights are updated by the RMSProp~\cite{tieleman2012lecture} with a mini-batch size of 8. The learning rate is set to 2.5$\times$$10^{-4}$. The size of the input to the proposed system is 88$\times$88$\times$88. We perform data augmentation including rotation ([-40, 40] degrees in XY space), scaling ([0.8, 1.2] in 3D space), and translation ([-8, 8] voxels in 3D space). Our model is implemented by Torch7~\cite{collobert2011torch7} and the NVIDIA Titan X GPU is used for training and testing. We trained our model for 10 epochs.
