\caption{Mean accuracy over validation samples and DSC for the segmentation of the validation images, as obtained by a single-scale model (Deep\texttt{+}) and our dual pathway architecture (DeepMedic). We also trained a single-scale model with larger capacity (BigDeep\texttt{+}), similar to the capacity of DeepMedic. DeepMedic yields best performance by capturing greater context, while BigDeep\texttt{+} seems to suffer from over-fitting.
