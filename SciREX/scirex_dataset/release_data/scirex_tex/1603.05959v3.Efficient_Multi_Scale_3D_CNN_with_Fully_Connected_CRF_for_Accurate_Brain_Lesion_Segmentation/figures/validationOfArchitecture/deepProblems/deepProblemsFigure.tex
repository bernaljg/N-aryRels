\caption{Mean accuracy over validation samples and DSC for the segmentations of the validation images, as obtained from the \quot{Shallow} baseline and \quot{Deep} variant with smaller kernels. Training of the plain deeper model fails (cf. Sec.~\ref{subsec:valDeeper}). This is overcome by adopting the initialization scheme of (\cite{he2015delving}), which further combined with Batch Normalization leads to the enhanced (\texttt{+}) variants. Deep\texttt{+} performs significantly better than Shallow\texttt{+} with similar computation time, thanks to the use of small kernels.
