\caption{Examples of DeepMedic's segmentation from its evaluation on the training datasets of BRATS 2015. cyan: necrotic core, green: oedema, orange: non-enhancing core, red: enhancing core. (top and middle) Satisfying segmentation of the tumor, regardless motion artefacts in certain sequences. (bottom) One of the worst cases of over-segmentation observed. False segmentation of FLAIR hyper-intensities as oedema constitutes the most common error of DeepMedic.}
