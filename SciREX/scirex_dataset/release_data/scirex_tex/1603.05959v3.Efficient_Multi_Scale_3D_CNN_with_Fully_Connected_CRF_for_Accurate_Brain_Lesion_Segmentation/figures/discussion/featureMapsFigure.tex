\caption{(First row) GE scan and DeepMedic's segmentation. (Second row) FMs of earlier and (third row) deeper layers of the first convolutional pathway. (Fourth row) Features learnt in the low-resolution pathway. (Last row) FMs of the two last hidden layers, which combine multi-resolution features towards the final segmentation.}
