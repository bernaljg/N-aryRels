We introduce the Variational Fair Autoencoder (VFAE), an extension of the semi-supervised variational autoencoder in order to learn representations that are explicitly invariant with respect to some known aspect of a dataset while retaining as much remaining information as possible. We further use a Maximum Mean Discrepancy regularizer in order to further promote invariance in the posterior distribution over latent variables. We apply this model to tasks involving developing fair classifiers that are invariant to sensitive demographic information and show that it produces a better tradeoff with respect to accuracy and invariance. As a second application, we consider the task of domain adaptation, where the goal is to improve classification by training a classifier that is invariant to the domain. We find that our model is competitive with recently proposed adversarial approaches. Finally, we also consider the more general task of learning invariant representations. We can observe that our model provides a clear improvement against a neural network that incorporates a Maximum Mean Discrepancy penalty.
