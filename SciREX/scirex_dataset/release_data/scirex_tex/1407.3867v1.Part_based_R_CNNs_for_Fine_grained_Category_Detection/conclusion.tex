\section{Conclusion}
We have proposed a system for joint object detection and part localization capable of state-of-the-art fine-grained object recognition. Our method learns detectors and part models and enforces learned geometric constraints between parts and with the object frame. 
Our experimental results demonstrate that even with a very strong feature representation and object detection system, it is highly beneficial to additionally model an object's pose by means of parts for the difficult task of fine-grained discrimination between categories with high semantic similarity.
In future extensions of this work, we will consider methods which jointly model at training time the object category and each of its parts and deformation costs.
We also plan to explore the weakly supervised setting in which we automatically discover and model parts as latent variables from only the object bounding box annotations.
Finally, we will consider relaxing the use of selective search for smaller parts and employing dense window sampling.
