% Use the following line _only_ if you're still using LaTeX 2.09.
%\documentstyle[icml2016,epsf,natbib]{article}
% If you rely on Latex2e packages, like most moden people use this:
\documentclass{article}

% use Times
\usepackage{times}
% For figures
\usepackage{graphicx} % more modern

\usepackage{caption}
\usepackage{subcaption}

% For citations
\usepackage{natbib}
\usepackage{multirow}

% For algorithms
\usepackage{algorithm}
\usepackage{algorithmic}

\usepackage{booktabs}

% As of 2011, we use the hyperref package to produce hyperlinks in the
% resulting PDF.  If this breaks your system, please commend out the
% following usepackage line and replace \usepackage{icml2016} with
% \usepackage[nohyperref]{icml2016} above.
\usepackage{hyperref}

% Packages hyperref and algorithmic misbehave sometimes.  We can fix
% this with the following command.
\newcommand{\theHalgorithm}{\arabic{algorithm}}

\renewcommand{\vec}{\mathbf}


% Employ the following version of the ``usepackage'' statement for
% submitting the draft version of the paper for review.  This will set

% \usepackage[accepted]{icml2016_arxiv} 

% Employ this version of the ``usepackage'' statement after the paper has
% been accepted, when creating the final version.  This will set the
