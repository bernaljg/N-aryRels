\section{Conclusions}\label{s:conc}
We have shown that it is possible to train neural networks into semantic clusterers without using labels or heuristics. The novel objective presented relies on statistical learning, by optimising mutual information between related pairs - a relationship that can be generated by random transforms - and naturally avoids degenerate solutions. The resulting models classify and segment images with state-of-the-art levels of semantic accuracy. Being not specific to vision, the method opens up many interesting research directions, including optimising information in datastreams over time.
