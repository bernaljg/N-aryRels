In this paper, we have presented WSDDN, a simple modification of a pre-trained CNN for image classification that allows it to perform weakly supervised detection. It achieves significantly better performance than existing methods on weakly supervised detection, while requiring only fine-tuning on a target dataset using back-propagation, region proposals and image-level labels. Since it works on top of a SPP layer, it is also efficient at training and test time. WSDDN is also shown to perform better than traditional fine-tuning techniques to improve the performance of a pre-trained CNN on the problem of image classification.

We have identified the detection of object parts as a failure modality of the method, damaging its performance in selected object categories, and imputed that to the main criterion used to identify objects, namely the selection of highly-distinctive image regions. We are currently exploring complementary cues that would favour detecting complete objects instead.
