\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conc}
In this work we have introduced 
MultiGrain, a unified embedding for image classification and instance retrieval.
MultiGrain relies on a classical convolutional neural network trunk, with a GeM layer topped with two heads at training time.
We have discovered that by adjusting this pooling layer we are able to increase the resolution of images used a inference time, while maintaining a small resolution at training time. 
We have shown that MultiGrain embeddings can perform well on classification and retrieval. 
Interestingly, MultiGrain also sets a new state of the art on pure classification compared to all results obtained with the same convolutional trunk.

Overall, our results show that retrieval and classification tasks can benefit from each other. 

An implementation of our method is open-sourced at \url{https://github.com/facebookresearch/multigrain}.
