\section{Conclusion}
We presented and approach based on a volumetric convolutional neural network that performs segmentation of MRI prostate volumes in a fast and accurate manner. We introduced a novel objective function that we optimise during training based on the Dice overlap coefficient between the predicted segmentation and the ground truth annotation. Our Dice loss layer does not need sample re-weighting when the amount of background and foreground pixels is strongly unbalanced and is indicated for binary segmentation tasks. Although we inspired our architecture to the one proposed in \cite{ronneberger2015u}, we divided it into stages that learn residuals and, as empirically observed, improve both results and convergence time. Future works will aim at segmenting volumes containing multiple regions in other modalities such as ultrasound and at higher resolutions by splitting the network over multiple GPUs.
