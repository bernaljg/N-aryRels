\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have presented a novel formulation of 3DMMs re-imagined for use in ``in-the-wild'' conditions. We capitalise on the annotated ``in-the-wild'' facial databases to propose a methodology for learning an ``in-the-wild'' feature-based texture model suitable for 3DMM fitting without having to optimise for illumination parameters. Furthermore, we propose a novel optimisation procedure for 3DMM fitting. We show that we are able to recover shapes with more detail than is possible using purely landmark-driven approaches.
Our newly introduced ``in-the-wild'' KinectFusion dataset allows for the first time a quantitative evaluation of 3D facial reconstruction techniques in the wild, and on these evaluations we demonstrate that our in the wild formulation is state of the art, outperforming classical 3DMM approaches by a considerable margin.
