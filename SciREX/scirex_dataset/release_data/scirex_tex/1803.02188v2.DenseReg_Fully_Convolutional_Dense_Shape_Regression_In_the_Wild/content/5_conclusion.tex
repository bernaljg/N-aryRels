\section{Conclusion}\label{S:CONCLUSIONS}
We propose a fully-convolutional regression approach for establishing dense correspondence fields between objects in natural images and three-dimensional object templates. We demonstrate that the correspondence information can successfully be utilised on problems that can be geometrically represented on the template shape.
Furthermore, we unify the problems of dense shape regression and articulated pose of estimation of deformable objects, by proposing the first, to the best of our knowledge, end-to-end trainable architecture that performance dense shape estimation and face landmark/body part localization. Throughout the paper, we focus on face and body shapes, where applications are abundant and benchmarks allow a fair comparison. We show that using our dense regression method out-of-the-box  outperforms a state-of-the-art semantic segmentation approach for the task of face-part segmentation, while when used as an initialisation for SDMs,  we obtain the state-of-the-art results on the challenging 300W landmark localization challenge. We demonstrate the generality of our method by performing experiments on the human body and human ear shapes. We believe that our method will find ubiquitous use, since it can be readily used for face-related tasks and can be easily integrated into many other correspondence problems.
