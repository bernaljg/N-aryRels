In this paper, we have proposed a new methodology for combining kernels
and convolutional neural networks. We show that  
mixing the ideas of these two concepts is fruitful,
since we achieve near state-of-the-art performance 
on several datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR-10, and STL10, with simple architectures
and no data augmentation.
Some challenges regarding our work are left open for the future. The first one
is the use of supervision to better approximate the kernel for the prediction
task. The second consists in leveraging the kernel interpretation of our
convolutional neural networks to better understand the theoretical properties
of the feature spaces that these networks produce.
