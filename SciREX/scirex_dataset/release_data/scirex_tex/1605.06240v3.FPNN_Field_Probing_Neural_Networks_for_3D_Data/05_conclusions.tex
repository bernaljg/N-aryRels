We proposed a novel design for feature extraction from 3D data, whose computation cost is agnostic to the resolution of data representation. A significant advantage of our design is that long range interaction can be easily coupled. As 3D data is becoming more accessible, we believe that our method will stimulate more work on feature learning from 3D data. We open-source our code at \url{https://github.com/yangyanli/FPNN} for encouraging future developments.
