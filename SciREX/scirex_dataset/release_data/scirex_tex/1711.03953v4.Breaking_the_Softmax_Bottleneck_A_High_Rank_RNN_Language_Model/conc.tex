\section{Conclusions}

Under the matrix factorization framework, the expressiveness of Softmax-based language models is limited by the dimension of the word embeddings, which is termed as the Softmax bottleneck. Our proposed MoS model improves the expressiveness over Softmax, and at the same time avoids overfitting compared to non-parametric models and naively increasing the word embedding dimensions. Our method improves the current state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks by a large margin, which in turn justifies our theoretical reasoning: it is important to have a high-rank model for natural language.
