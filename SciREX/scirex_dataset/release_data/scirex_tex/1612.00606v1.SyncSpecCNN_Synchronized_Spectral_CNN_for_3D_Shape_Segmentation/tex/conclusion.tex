We introduce a novel neural network architecture, the Synchronized Spectral CNN (SyncSpecCNN), for semantic annotation on 3D shape graphs. To share coefficients and conduct multi-scale analysis in different parts of a single shape graph, we introduce a spectral parametrization of dilated convolutional kernels. To allow parameter sharing across related but different shapes that may be represented by very different graphs, we introduce a spectral transformer network to synchronize different spectral domains. The effectiveness of different components in our network is validated through extensive experiments. Jointly these contributions lead to state-of-the-art performance on various semantic annotation tasks including 3D shape part segmentation and 3D keypoint prediction.
