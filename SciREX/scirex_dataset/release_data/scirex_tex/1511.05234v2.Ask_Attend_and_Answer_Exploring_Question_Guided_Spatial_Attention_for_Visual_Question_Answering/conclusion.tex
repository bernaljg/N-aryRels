\section{Conclusion}
\vspace{-0.1in}
In this paper, we proposed the Spatial Memory Network for VQA, a memory network architecture with a spatial attention mechanism adapted to the visual question answering task. We proposed a set of synthetic spatial questions and demonstrated that our model learns inference rules based on spatial attention through attention weight visualization. Evaluation on the challenging DAQUAR and VQA datasets showed  improved results over previously published models. Our model can be used to visualize the inference steps learned by the deep network, giving some insight into its processing. Future work may include further exploring the inference ability of our SMem-VQA model  and exploring other VQA attention models.
